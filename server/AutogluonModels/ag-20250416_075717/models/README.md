# ðŸ§  AutoGluon Trained Models

This directory contains various trained machine learning models used for the **Smart Budget Allocation System** or related tasks. These models are part of the AutoGluon ensemble, which combines the predictions of multiple models to achieve superior performance.

Each model file represents a specific machine learning algorithm, and the models are all part of an ensemble learning system designed to make accurate budget predictions.

## ðŸš€ How to Use These Models

Each model can be loaded and used independently or as part of the ensemble for predictions. Hereâ€™s how to load and use a model with **AutoGluon**:

```python
from autogluon.tabular import TabularPredictor

# Example: Load and make predictions with a specific model
predictor = TabularPredictor.load("path_to_model/LightGBM")

# Predict on new data
predictions = predictor.predict(new_data_df)
