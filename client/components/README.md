# ðŸ§© UI Components Library

Welcome to the **Smart Budget Allocation System â€“ UI Component Library**, a modular and reusable set of components built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ShadCN/UI** conventions. These components power the user interface of the Smart Budget Allocation System, including the responsive `LandingPage`, dashboards, and utilities.
## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with this UI library:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have the following:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
2. Tailwind Setup
Ensure your tailwind.config.js includes:

js
Copy
Edit
content: [
  "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",

],
3. Importing Components
Use components directly:

tsx

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
